Use the following commands to test the code after creating an executable of this code.

Create Executable
gcc -g -o db ./db.cpp

Note: Assuming db.cpp and db.h both belong to the same folder inside a gcc container

==============================================================================

Create Test Tables
./db "create table employee (emp_id int NOT NULL, f_name char(20), l_name char(20), dept char(20))"
./db "create table department (dept_id char(20) NOT NULL, dept_name char(20))"

Insert into Employee Table
./db "insert into employee values (1001, 'Aditya', 'Dawadikar', '2001')"
./db "insert into employee values (1002, 'Rudraksh', 'Naik', '2001')"
./db "insert into employee values (1003, 'Shubhankar', 'Munshi', '2002')"
./db "insert into employee values (1004, 'Mandar', 'Gondane', '2002')"

Insert into Department Table
./db "insert into department values ('2001', 'AWS')"
./db "insert into department values ('2002', 'GCP')"

Sample Select Queries
./db "select * from employee"
./db "select emp_id, f_name, l_name, dept from employee"
./db "select * from department"
./db "select dept_id, dept_name from department"
./db "select emp_id, f_name, l_name, dept_name from employee natural join department on dept = dept_id"
./db "select dept_name, emp_id, f_name, l_name from department natural join employee on dept_id = dept"
./db "select emp_id, f_name, l_name, dept_name from employee natural join department on dept = dept_id where dept='2001'"
./db "select emp_id, f_name, l_name, dept_name from employee natural join department on dept = dept_id where emp_id=1001"
./db "select emp_id, f_name, l_name, dept_name from employee natural join department on dept = dept_id where dept='2002' order by emp_id"
./db "select * from employee natural join department on dept = dept_id"
./db "select * from employee natural join department on dept = dept_id where dept_name='GCP'"

./db "select * from employee natural join department on dept = dept_id order by emp_id"
./db "select * from employee natural join department on dept = dept_id order by emp_id where dept_name='GCP'"

./db "select count(emp_id) from employee"
./db "select sum(emp_id) from employee"
./db "select avg(emp_id) from employee"
./db "select count(emp_id) from employee where dept='2002'"

./db "delete from employee where emp_id=1001"
./db "select * from employee where emp_id=1001 or l_name='Munshi'"
